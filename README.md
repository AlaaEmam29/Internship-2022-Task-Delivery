## Explaining the project 

This is a website template for a coffee shop implemented using HTML, CSS, vanilla javascript, and bootstrap. This website has 3 sections a header at the top with a navigation bar and a footer at the bottom that continues the subscriber form.

Well, beginning with the land page, it simply continues the background with some text in it.

Followed by the "about" section, a container with 2 items The first item is an image with some CSS effects, and the second paragraph is text with CSS styles.

Then we have the gallery that has some images of coffee, and at the bottom of every image, you can find a description. I used the grid system in bootstrap to design it.

Lastly, we have a footer and subscription forms.

The web application is based on CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and the Bootstrap framework.

This website is a fully responsive , so you can use the mobile version of this website.

## Requirements:

I wrote my code on visual studio code and used github pages to make a web link so that anyone can access it.
